Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component. This could happen for one of the following reasons:\\n1. You might have mismatching versions of React and the renderer (such as React DOM)\\n2. You might be breaking the Rules of Hooks\\n3. You might have more than one copy of React in the same app\\nSee https://react.dev/link/invalid-hook-call for tips about how to debug and fix this problem.\"\n        );\n      return dispatcher;\n    }\n    function releaseAsyncTransition() {\n      ReactSharedInternals.asyncTransitions--;\n    }\n    function startTransition(scope) {\n      var prevTransition = ReactSharedInternals.T,\n        currentTransition = {};\n      currentTransition.types =\n        null !== prevTransition ? prevTransition.types : null;\n      currentTransition._updatedFibers = new Set();\n      ReactSharedInternals.T = currentTransition;\n      try {\n        var returnValue = scope(),\n          onStartTransitionFinish = ReactSharedInternals.S;\n        null !== onStartTransitionFinish &&\n          onStartTransitionFinish(currentTransition, returnValue);\n        \"object\" === typeof returnValue &&\n          null !== returnValue &&\n          \"function\" === typeof returnValue.then &&\n          (ReactSharedInternals.asyncTransitions++,\n          returnValue.then(releaseAsyncTransition, releaseAsyncTransition),\n          returnValue.then(noop, reportGlobalError));\n      } catch (error) {\n        reportGlobalError(error);\n      } finally {\n        null === prevTransition &&\n          currentTransition._updatedFibers &&\n          ((scope = currentTransition._updatedFibers.size),\n          currentTransition._updatedFibers.clear(),\n          10 < scope &&\n            console.warn(\n              \"Detected a large number of updates inside startTransition.

When an entry is\n * stored with Fallback as part of its keypath, it means that the entry does not\n * vary by that key. When querying the cache, if an exact match is not found for\n * a keypath, the cache will check for a Fallback match instead. Each element of\n * the keypath may have a Fallback, so retrieval is an O(n ^ 2) operation, but\n * it's expected that keypaths are relatively short.\n *\n * Example:\n *   set(cacheMap, ['store', 'product', 1], PRODUCT_PAGE_1);\n *   set(cacheMap, ['store', 'product', Fallback], GENERIC_PRODUCT_PAGE);\n *\n *   // Exact match\n *   get(cacheMap, ['store', 'product', 1]) -> PRODUCT_PAGE_1\n *\n *   // Fallback match\n *   get(cacheMap, ['store', 'product', 2]) -> GENERIC_PRODUCT_PAGE\n *\n * Because we have the Fallback mechanism, we can impose a constraint that\n * regular JS maps do not have: a value cannot be stored at multiple keypaths\n * simultaneously. These cases should be expressed with Fallback keys instead.\n *\n * Additionally, because values only exist at a single keypath at a time, we\n * can optimize successive lookups by caching the internal map entry on the\n * value itself, using the `ref` field. This is especially useful because it\n * lets us skip the O(n ^ 2) lookup that occurs when Fallback entries\n * are present.\n *\n\n * How to decide if stuff belongs in here, or in cache.ts?\n * -------------------------------------------------------\n * \n * Anything to do with retrival, lifetimes, or eviction needs to go in this\n * module because it affects the fallback algorithm. For example, when\n * performing a lookup, if an entry is stale, it needs to be treated as\n * semantically equivalent to if the entry was not present at all.\n * \n * If there's logic that's not related to the fallback algorithm, though, we\n * should prefer to put it in cache.ts.\n */\n\n// The protocol that values must implement.

For example,\n * /blog/post-1 and /blog/post-2 both resolve to /blog/[slug]. Once we've\n * prefetched one, we can predict the structure of the other.\n *\n * However, we can't always make this prediction.

Routes are always inserted into the\n *    cache.\n *\n * 2. matchKnownRoute: Called when looking up a route with no cache entry.\n *    Matches the candidate URL against learned patterns. Returns a synthetic\n *    cache entry if successful, or null to fall back to server resolution.\n *\n * Rewrite detection happens during traversal: if a URL path part doesn't match\n * the corresponding route segment, we stop populating the known route tree\n * (since the mapping is incorrect) but still insert the route into the cache.\n *\n * The known route tree is append-only with no eviction. Route patterns are\n * derived from the filesystem, so they don't become stale within a session.\n * Cache invalidation on deploy clears everything anyway.\n *\n * Current limitations (deopt to server resolution):\n * - Rewrites: Detected during traversal (tree not populated, but route cached)\n * - Intercepted routes: Routes using (.), (..), (...) patterns\n */\n\nimport type { DynamicParamTypesShort } from '../../../shared/lib/app-router-types'\nimport type { RouteTree, FulfilledRouteCacheEntry } from './cache'\nimport {\n  EntryStatus,\n  writeRouteIntoCache,\n  fulfillRouteCacheEntry,\n  type PendingRouteCacheEntry,\n  createMetadataRouteTree,\n} from './cache'\nimport { doesStaticSegmentAppearInURL } from '../../route-params'\nimport type { NormalizedPathname, NormalizedSearch } from './cache-key'\nimport {\n  appendLayoutVaryPath,\n  finalizeLayoutVaryPath,\n  finalizePageVaryPath,\n  finalizeMetadataVaryPath,\n  type PartialSegmentVaryPath,\n  type PageVaryPath,\n} from './vary-path'\n\n/**\n * The known route tree is analogous to a route table.

There are really two different kinds of\n * Dynamic indications.\n *\n * The first is simply an intention to be dynamic. unstable_noStore is an example of this where\n * the currently executing code simply declares that the current scope is dynamic but if you use it\n * inside unstable_cache it can still be cached. This type of indication can be removed if we ever\n * make the default dynamic to begin with because the only way you would ever be static is inside\n * a cache scope which this indication does not affect.\n *\n * The second is an indication that a dynamic data source was read. This is a stronger form of dynamic\n * because it means that it is inappropriate to cache this at all. using a dynamic data source inside\n * unstable_cache should error. If you want to use some dynamic data inside unstable_cache you should\n * read that data outside the cache and pass it in as an argument to the cached function.\n */\n\nimport type { WorkStore } from '../app-render/work-async-storage.external'\nimport type {\n  WorkUnitStore,\n  PrerenderStoreLegacy,\n  PrerenderStoreModern,\n  PrerenderStoreModernRuntime,\n} from '../app-render/work-unit-async-storage.external'\n\n// Once postpone is in stable we should switch to importing the postpone export directly\nimport React from 'react'\n\nimport { DynamicServerError } from '../../client/components/hooks-server-context'\nimport { StaticGenBailoutError } from '../../client/components/static-generation-bailout'\nimport {\n  getRuntimeStagePromise,\n  throwForMissingRequestStore,\n  workUnitAsyncStorage,\n} from './work-unit-async-storage.external'\nimport { workAsyncStorage } from '../app-render/work-async-storage.external'\nimport { makeHangingPromise } from '../dynamic-rendering-utils'\nimport {\n  METADATA_BOUNDARY_NAME,\n  VIEWPORT_BOUNDARY_NAME,\n  OUTLET_BOUNDARY_NAME,\n  ROOT_LAYOUT_BOUNDARY_NAME,\n} from '../../lib/framework/boundary-constants'\nimport { scheduleOnNextTick } from '../../lib/scheduler'\nimport { BailoutToCSRError } from '../../shared/lib/lazy-dynamic/bailout-to-csr'\nimport { InvariantError } from '../../shared/lib/invariant-error'\n\nconst hasPostpone = typeof React.unstable_postpone === 'function'\n\nexport type DynamicAccess = {\n  /**\n   * If debugging, this will contain the stack trace of where the dynamic access\n   * occurred.
