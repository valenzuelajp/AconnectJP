/**
 * Optimistic Routing (Known Routes)
 *
 * This module enables the client to predict route structure for URLs that
 * haven't been prefetched yet, based on previously learned route patterns.
 * When successful, this allows skipping the route tree prefetch request
 * entirely.
 *
 * The core idea is that many URLs map to the same route structure. For example,
 * /blog/post-1 and /blog/post-2 both resolve to /blog/[slug]. Once we've
 * prefetched one, we can predict the structure of the other.
 *
 * However, we can't always make this prediction. Static siblings (like
 * /blog/featured alongside /blog/[slug]) have different route structures.
 * When we learn a dynamic route, we also learn its static siblings so we
 * know when NOT to apply the prediction.
 *
 * Main entry points:
 *
 * 1. discoverKnownRoute: Called after receiving a route tree from the server.
 *    Traverses the route tree, compares URL parts to segments, and populates
 *    the known route tree if they match. Routes are always inserted into the
 *    cache.
 *
 * 2. matchKnownRoute: Called when looking up a route with no cache entry.
 *    Matches the candidate URL against learned patterns. Returns a synthetic
 *    cache entry if successful, or null to fall back to server resolution.
 *
 * Rewrite detection happens during traversal: if a URL path part doesn't match
 * the corresponding route segment, we stop populating the known route tree
 * (since the mapping is incorrect) but still insert the route into the cache.
 *
 * The known route tree is append-only with no eviction. Route patterns are
 * derived from the filesystem, so they don't become stale within a session.
 * Cache invalidation on deploy clears everything anyway.
 *
 * Current limitations (deopt to server resolution):
 * - Rewrites: Detected during traversal (tree not populated, but route cached)
 * - Intercepted routes: Routes using (.), (..), (...) patterns
