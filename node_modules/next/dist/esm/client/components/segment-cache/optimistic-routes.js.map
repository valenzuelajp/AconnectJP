For example,\n * /blog/post-1 and /blog/post-2 both resolve to /blog/[slug]. Once we've\n * prefetched one, we can predict the structure of the other.\n *\n * However, we can't always make this prediction. Static siblings (like\n * /blog/featured alongside /blog/[slug]) have different route structures.\n * When we learn a dynamic route, we also learn its static siblings so we\n * know when NOT to apply the prediction.\n *\n * Main entry points:\n *\n * 1. discoverKnownRoute: Called after receiving a route tree from the server.\n *    Traverses the route tree, compares URL parts to segments, and populates\n *    the known route tree if they match. Routes are always inserted into the\n *    cache.\n *\n * 2. matchKnownRoute: Called when looking up a route with no cache entry.\n *    Matches the candidate URL against learned patterns. Returns a synthetic\n *    cache entry if successful, or null to fall back to server resolution.\n *\n * Rewrite detection happens during traversal: if a URL path part doesn't match\n * the corresponding route segment, we stop populating the known route tree\n * (since the mapping is incorrect) but still insert the route into the cache.\n *\n * The known route tree is append-only with no eviction. Route patterns are\n * derived from the filesystem, so they don't become stale within a session.\n * Cache invalidation on deploy clears everything anyway.\n *\n * Current limitations (deopt to server resolution):\n * - Rewrites: Detected during traversal (tree not populated, but route cached)\n * - Intercepted routes: Routes using (.), (..), (...) patterns\n */\n\nimport type { DynamicParamTypesShort } from '../../../shared/lib/app-router-types'\nimport type { RouteTree, FulfilledRouteCacheEntry } from './cache'\nimport {\n  EntryStatus,\n  writeRouteIntoCache,\n  fulfillRouteCacheEntry,\n  type PendingRouteCacheEntry,\n  createMetadataRouteTree,\n} from './cache'\nimport { doesStaticSegmentAppearInURL } from '../../route-params'\nimport type { NormalizedPathname, NormalizedSearch } from './cache-key'\nimport {\n  appendLayoutVaryPath,\n  finalizeLayoutVaryPath,\n  finalizePageVaryPath,\n  finalizeMetadataVaryPath,\n  type PartialSegmentVaryPath,\n  type PageVaryPath,\n} from './vary-path'\n\n/**\n * The known route tree is analogous to a route table. A different routing\n * implementation might use regexes or URLPattern; ours uses a trie indexed\n * by URL path segments.\n *\n * Each node (KnownRoutePart) represents a position in the URL and can have:\n * - staticChildren: Map of literal segments to child nodes\n * - dynamicChild: A single dynamic segment node ([slug], [...params], etc.)\n * - pattern: A cache entry template for routes that terminate here\n *\n * This tree only contains segments that correspond to actual filesystem routes.\n * Route groups like (marketing) and parallel routes like @modal are not\n * included since they don't appear in URLs. Similarly, if a URL is rewritten\n * to a different filesystem path, the original URL segments don't appear here\n * — only the resolved filesystem route structure is stored.\n *\n * Example tree after learning /blog/[slug], /blog/featured, and /about:\n *\n *   ├── about\n *   └── blog\n *       ├── featured\n *       └── [slug]\n *\n * When matching /blog/hello:\n *   1. \"blog\" matches static child\n *   2. \"hello\" doesn't match \"featured\", falls through to [slug]\n *   3.
